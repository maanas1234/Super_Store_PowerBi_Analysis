## Retail Sales & Profit Analysis (Power BI)

## Overview

This project presents a sales and profitability analysis of a retail store using Power BI. The analysis focuses on understanding how revenue, profit, and efficiency vary across time, regions, and product categories during the period **2019–2020**. The goal of this project is not only to visualize data, but to interpret it and extract meaningful business insights.

---

## Objective

The primary objectives of this analysis are:

* To evaluate overall sales and profit performance
* To compare revenue growth against profitability
* To identify high-performing and underperforming regions
* To analyze category-level contribution to profit and revenue
* To highlight inefficiencies where sales do not translate into profit

---

## Dataset

* Transactional retail dataset (~6,000 rows, 22 columns)
* Time period: 2019–2020
* Key fields include:

  * Order and ship dates
  * Customer and location details
  * Product categories and sub-categories
  * Sales, profit, and quantity

A derived column was created to calculate **average delivery time** across regions.

---

## Dashboard Features

* Key KPIs: Total Sales, Total Profit, Profit Margin
* Sales and profit trends over time
* Category-wise and region-wise performance
* Segment and ship-mode breakdowns
* Interactive filters for deeper exploration

---

## Key Insights

* Revenue growth in 2020 did not result in proportional profit growth, indicating margin pressure.
* The West region consistently outperformed other regions, while the Central region showed inefficiency despite higher revenue.
* Furniture generated a large share of revenue but contributed minimal profit, making it the weakest category.
* Profit volatility during high-sales periods suggests pricing or cost inefficiencies.
* A small number of regions and categories drive the majority of overall profitability.

---

## Tools & Technologies

* Power BI (data modeling, visualization)
* DAX (calculated measures and derived columns)

---

## Learning Outcome

This project represents my **first end-to-end data analysis**, focusing on:

* Moving beyond chart descriptions to insight-driven analysis
* Comparing performance using relative metrics (profit %, margins)
* Structuring analytical thinking into a formal report

Future projects will focus on deeper DAX usage, cleaner storytelling, and more refined business recommendations.

## Notes

This project is intentionally left in its original form to reflect my learning process. Improvements and refinements will be applied in subsequent projects.
